# Example config *fragment* for quad-image. This must be placed in a server block.

# note: this config assumes that you have most security configured at the server
# block level, or in your provisioning system. There is no security listed here,
# you almost certainly want to set X-XSS-Protection and X-Content-Type-Options,
# and probably Content-Security-Policy.
